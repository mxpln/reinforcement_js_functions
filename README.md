## 4. The Geometrizer

Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

Create a function called **calcCircumference**:

-   Pass the radius to the function.
-   Calculate the circumference based on the radius (two decimals), and return "The circumference is NN".

Display the result of the function in the console, with a radius of 5.

Create a function called **calcArea**:

-   Pass the radius to the function.
-   Calculate the area based on the radius (two decimals), and return "The area is NN".

Display the result of function in the console, with a radius of 4.5

*   Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
*   Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".

-   Create a function called **fahrenheitToCelsius**:

    -   Help: https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/83cff534d2e96165cbe9245bd9abc5d5d96d94f0

*   Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
*   Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."
